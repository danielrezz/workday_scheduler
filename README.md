<p>
    Simply choose a timeblock where you would like to enter an event that you have planned for your day. If you have a meeting at 11am, enter that in and click the save button. Notice that even if you close your browser or refresh, the planned event will still populate in the designated hour.

<p>
    Aside from being able to save your changes and come back to them whenever, you will also find at the top of the page, a real time clock that shows the current date and time. Based on the time depicted in the clock, the timeblocks will change color to show whether a particular event has passed or is coming up.

    Challenges
</h2>

<p>
    This project had numerous challenges. I struggled with my first concept idea of using a code formula to create all the divs on the page. This took a lot of time and ultimately had to just settle for creating different divs for each time block. I also struggled with setting up local storage to efficiently store the data. The code used was definitely not efficient.



    The biggest challenge was getting the colors to change based on the hour. I unfortunately was unable to figure that out. I tried a couple of different ways but did not have enough time. I will definitely be revisiting this to complete and accomplish that.
